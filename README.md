# Subscription-Based-Newsletter-Platform-SBP-
The Subscription-Based Newsletter Platform is a web application designed to allow creators to publish exclusive content and monetize their audience through recurring subscriptions. The platform provides a simple content editor for creators and a secure sign-up and payment gateway for subscribers. It aims to be a minimal alternative to services like Substack or Revue, focusing
specifically on content creation, subscriber management, and access control.
